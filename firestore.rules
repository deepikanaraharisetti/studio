/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CrewUp Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a mix of user-ownership and public-read/owner-write patterns, with specific rules for managing team collaborations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}:  User profile data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /opportunities/{opportunityId}: Publicly readable opportunities, writable only by the opportunity creator.
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Team data, with membership managed via the `memberIds` array.
 * - /teams/{teamId}/messages/{messageId}: Chat messages within teams, accessible to team members.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /opportunities collection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Opportunities have an `authorId` field to simplify ownership checks for writes.
 * - Teams have a `memberIds` array to streamline access control for team-related data.
