# Firebase Studio

This is a Next.js starter project for Firebase Studio. It's a talent and project discovery platform called "CrewUp".

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Running Locally

To run this application on your local machine, please follow these step-by-step instructions.

### Step 1: Download the Complete Project

Ensure you have downloaded the **entire project folder**. The project relies on configuration files located in the root directory, so the `src` folder alone is not enough.

### Step 2: Open Your Command Prompt or Terminal

Navigate to the root directory of your downloaded project folder.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Once you are inside the project's root directory, run the following command to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary libraries for the project to function.

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

After the installation is complete, you can start the local development server with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode.

### Step 5: View Your Application

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:9002`. You should now see your application running!
