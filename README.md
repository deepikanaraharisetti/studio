# Firebase Studio

This is a Next.js starter project for Firebase Studio. It's a talent and project discovery platform called "CrewUp".

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Running Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to install all the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server**: Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server with this command:

    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the application, and you'll be able to view it in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:9002`.
